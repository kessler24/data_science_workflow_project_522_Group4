# Contributing to Predicting Daily Land Average Earth Temperature

This outlines how to propose a change to the Predicting Daily Land Average Earth Temperature project. This project is designed to be completed by the members of Lab Group 4 in the Fall 2025 Class of DSCI 522 of the UBC MDS program, and all contributions should be designed to enhance Group 4's learning. Input, feedback, and ideas will be more valuable as a learning opportunity than completed code.
